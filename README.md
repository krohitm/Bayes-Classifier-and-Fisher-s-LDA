This is an implementation of **Bayes Classifier** and **Fisherâ€™s Linear Discriminant Analysis** to distinguish between species of rock crabs of genus Leptograpsus.

*	The code for the two classifiers can be accessed from their respective branches.
* The dataset is composed of 200 samples of different crab specimens. 

There are seven features that were captured for each specimen. These features include anatomical properties. The goal is to discriminate between the two species of crab using these provided features. The species of crab are given as binary labels in the 1st column of the provided dataset. The remaining seven columns of data are the real-valued features.
